          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Founded by a team of electronics engineers, Navkalpit was born from
            a firsthand understanding of the challenges in hardware development.
            Long lead times, inconsistent quality, and high costs were constant
            hurdles. We knew there had to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We built Navkalpit to be the service we always wished we had: a
            platform that combines cutting-edge technology with a passion for
            customer success. Our goal is to remove the friction from PCB
            manufacturing, allowing innovators to focus on what they do
            bestâ€”creating the future.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Today, we serve thousands of engineers, startups, and hobbyists
            worldwide, but our mission remains unchanged: to make custom circuit
            board manufacturing accessible, fast, and flawless.
